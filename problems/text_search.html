  I went back and forth on the approach of this one a few times. I initially
  thought about doing a tree-like search through the nodes, but instead opted
  for a more direct approach of stripping out the elements and doing a straight
  search off of that. The positives to this approach is the little overhead
  involved with strictly parsing out the elements and then doing a regular
  expression for the phrase passed in. On the flip side though, if I wanted to
  do more with this, i.e. highlight the area that was searched on, it would be
  rather difficult. Nonetheless, if I have time between now and then, I might
  look into implementing this and doing benchmarks between the two.

  I added a few smaller things to the markup, i.e. an id on the form element, a
  placeholder on the search bar, and a few other things. Since the results
  output was dynamic, I decided to create a quick and dirty template parser (if
  you can even call it that), to simulate how a client side template would be
  used.

		There are two main components below, a search form and a text article about turtles. The form should be setup such that a word or phase can be entered in the search form, and the number of occurences of that phrase is shown below. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, in the below text there are two occurences of the word "Testudines" so if you put that word in the search form, and submit, the results should say:

		<i>Found 2 occurances of the word "Testudines" in the below text.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that words can be contained within multiple levels of HTML elements, and phrases may cross those HTML element boundaries.

			The order Chelonii or Testudines includes both extant (living) and <a href="/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinct</a> species. The earliest known turtles date from <span class="nourlexpansion plainlinks" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://toolserver.org/~verisimilus/Timeline/Timeline.php?Ma=220">220</a> <a href="/wiki/Million_years_ago" title="Million years ago" class="mw-redirect">million years ago</a></span>,<sup id="cite_ref-Li-etal_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Li-etal-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than <a href="/wiki/Lizard" title="Lizard">lizards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snakes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Crocodile" title="Crocodile">crocodiles</a>.

			Like all other extant reptiles, turtles are <a href="/wiki/Ectotherm" title="Ectotherm">ectotherms</a> their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment, commonly called <a href="/wiki/Poikilotherm" title="Poikilotherm">cold-blooded</a>. However, because of their high metabolic rate, <a href="/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle" title="Leatherback sea turtle">leatherback sea turtles</a> have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like other <a href="/wiki/Amniote" title="Amniote">amniotes</a> (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals), they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water. The largest turtles are aquatic.
