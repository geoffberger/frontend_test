  With the image_rotator problem, I wanted to tackle it from two different
  approachs. I thought it would be neat to build out a class that could be
  flexible enough across a number of different situations. Those situations
  are:

  - Using existing markup and building out a rotator
  - Using completely different markup that self contained the rotator.

  The first one just seemed interesting with the problem was initially laid
  out. The second approach is something I would have done if I had control over
  the markup.

  Rotator

  The idea behind the Rotator is to allow "hooks" based off of your
  circumstance. The more I thought about it, the idea of a router is pretty
  generic and I wanted to keep it that way. Therefore, the intention is to use
  Rotator for things more specific, i.e. rotating images or text. In my
  examples, I didn't take this too far. Instead, I illustrated how one would
  hook into Rotator. I probably won't have time to get around to it, but this
  would allow extending Rotator to have things like a progress bar or visually
  show how many items are available and what is the current item.

  Approach #1

  I wanted to keep this as light weight as possible and use as little DOM
  manipulation as possible. Therefore, I created my "stage" with native DOM
  elements and just updated the values accordingly. I kept this version simple
  and to the point to accomplish the task at hand.

  Approach #2

  With this approach, I wanted to make sure that the default output would play
  nicely when JS is disabled, while being as lightweight as possible.
  Therefore, this approach positions element that are ready to be visible
  within the viewport and shows and hides them based off of opacity. This
  effect was done with a CSS transition for both ease and performance.

		Using the below images, make a rotator in the box below that shows only one of the Katarina skins every 3 seconds.  The rotator should also display the correct image title and description with each image change.
